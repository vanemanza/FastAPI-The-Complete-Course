Fast api comes with an interactive API documentation right out of the box.
This interactive documentation  is created using Swagger UI.
If we visit our URL for the project, followed by docs, we will get all of the APIs that are currently active within our application.

http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

Not only this, but we are able to see how the  request and response should look. And you're able to call the APIs right  from the documentation itself.
